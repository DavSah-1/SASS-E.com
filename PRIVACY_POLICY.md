## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for various purposes related to providing, maintaining, and improving the Service. Our specific uses include:

**Service Provision and Personalization:** We use your information to create and maintain your account, authenticate your identity, provide the features and functionality you request, personalize your experience based on your preferences and usage patterns, generate AI-powered recommendations and insights tailored to your goals and activities, and remember your settings and preferences across sessions.

**Communication:** We use your contact information to respond to your inquiries and support requests, send you service-related notifications and updates, provide important information about changes to our Terms or Privacy Policy, send you promotional communications about new features or offerings (which you may opt out of at any time), and facilitate communication between users when using shared or collaborative features.

**Analytics and Improvement:** We analyze usage patterns and user behavior to understand how the Service is used, identify areas for improvement, develop new features and functionality, optimize user experience and interface design, conduct research and analysis to improve our AI algorithms and recommendations, and measure the effectiveness of our features and marketing campaigns.

**Security and Fraud Prevention:** We use your information to detect, prevent, and respond to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues, enforce our Terms and Conditions and other policies, verify user identity and prevent unauthorized access, protect the rights, property, and safety of SASS-E, our users, and the public, and comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests from authorities.

**Legal Compliance:** We process your information as necessary to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal processes, respond to lawful requests from government authorities, enforce our legal rights and defend against legal claims, and fulfill our contractual obligations.

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland, we process your personal data only when we have a valid legal basis. Our legal bases for processing include:

**Consent:** We process certain personal data based on your explicit consent, such as when you authorize us to access your wearable device data, enable location services, or opt in to marketing communications. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time through your account settings or by contacting us.

**Contractual Necessity:** We process personal data that is necessary to perform our contract with you, including creating and maintaining your account, providing the features you request, processing payments for premium subscriptions, and delivering customer support.

**Legitimate Interests:** We process personal data based on our legitimate business interests, such as improving and developing the Service, conducting analytics, preventing fraud and abuse, ensuring security, and marketing our services to existing users. We balance these interests against your rights and freedoms and provide opt-out mechanisms where appropriate.

**Legal Obligations:** We process personal data when necessary to comply with legal obligations, such as responding to lawful requests from authorities, complying with tax and accounting requirements, and fulfilling data retention obligations.

## 5. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We share your information only in the limited circumstances described below:

**Service Providers:** We engage trusted third-party service providers to perform functions on our behalf, including cloud hosting and infrastructure providers, payment processors, email and communication services, analytics providers, customer support platforms, and AI and machine learning service providers. These service providers have access to your personal information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes for which it was disclosed.

**Business Transfers:** If SASS-E is involved in a merger, acquisition, asset sale, bankruptcy, or other business transaction, your personal information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via email and/or prominent notice on the Service of any change in ownership or use of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.

**Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose your information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

**With Your Consent:** We may share your information with third parties when you explicitly consent to such sharing, such as when you authorize integration with third-party services or choose to share your achievements or progress on social media.

**Aggregated and Anonymized Data:** We may share aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified data that cannot reasonably be used to identify you with third parties for research, analytics, marketing, or other purposes. This data does not contain any personally identifiable information.

**Shared Features:** If you use collaborative or shared features of the Service (such as shared budgets or group fitness challenges), the information you choose to share through these features will be visible to other participants as necessary to provide the functionality.

## 6. Data Security

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Our security measures include:

**Encryption:** We use industry-standard encryption protocols (TLS/SSL) to protect data in transit between your device and our servers. Sensitive data at rest is encrypted using strong encryption algorithms.

**Access Controls:** We implement strict access controls and authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access personal information, and only to the extent necessary to perform their job functions.

**Security Monitoring:** We continuously monitor our systems for potential security vulnerabilities and threats, conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing, and maintain incident response procedures to address security breaches promptly.

**Employee Training:** Our employees and contractors who have access to personal information receive training on data protection principles and security best practices.

**Third-Party Security:** We carefully vet our service providers and require them to implement appropriate security measures to protect your information.

Despite our security measures, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for any activities that occur under your account. Please notify us immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized access to your account.

## 7. Data Retention

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Our retention periods are based on the following criteria:

**Account Data:** We retain your account information and profile data for as long as your account remains active. If you delete your account, we will delete or anonymize your personal information within ninety (90) days, except where we are required to retain certain information for legal, regulatory, or legitimate business purposes.

**Usage Data:** We retain usage logs and analytics data for up to twenty-four (24) months for security, fraud prevention, and service improvement purposes.

**Backup Data:** Deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to ninety (90) days before being permanently deleted.

You may request deletion of your personal information at any time by contacting us or using the account deletion feature in your account settings. Please note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes even after you request deletion.
