    "hint": "Formal titles of address (Vocações) are required for high-ranking officials.",
    "explanation": "'Vossa Excelência' (Your Excellency) is the standard formal title used when addressing high-ranking officials, such as judges, ministers, or presidents.",
    "correctFeedback": "Ah, formality. Good thing you know how to talk to people who matter. Now, if only you could apply that respect to your language studies.",

    "options": "[\"Eu a comi ontem.\",\"Eu comi-a ontem.\",\"Eu comi ela ontem.\",\"Eu lhe comi ontem.\"]",
    "hint": "In European Portuguese (and often preferred formally in Brazil), the pronoun attaches to the verb in affirmative sentences, especially in simple tenses.",
    "explanation": "The direct object pronoun for 'a pizza' (feminine singular) is 'a'. In affirmative simple past, it attaches to the verb (enclisis). Since 'comi' ends in a vowel, the pronoun is simply attached with a hyphen: 'comi-a'. (Note: 'Eu a comi' is also grammatically correct, especially in Brazilian Portuguese, but 'comi-a' is a strong intermediate test of enclisis).",
    "correctFeedback": "Enclisis! You remembered the hyphen and the vowel! You must be showing off your European Portuguese skills, or maybe you just got lucky.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "You used the wrong pronoun or the wrong placement. 'Eu comi ela' is conversational slang, not intermediate grammar. Try to be better than casual conversation."

    "explanation": "In Portuguese, 'dele' (of him) is often used instead of the possessive adjective 'seus' to avoid ambiguity. 'Dele' agrees with the possessor (singular male) but is used to describe the books (plural). 'Deles' would mean the books belong to multiple people.",
    "correctFeedback": "Possessive ambiguity avoided! You chose the less confusing option. I didn't think you had that kind of foresight.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "You confused singular and plural possessors. Do the books belong to one person or many? Details matter, especially when dealing with ownership."

    "hint": "The analytic passive voice uses the verb 'ser' + past participle + agent of the passive ('por' or 'pelo/pela').",
    "explanation": "The analytic passive voice structure is Subject (O relatório) + Auxiliary Verb 'Ser' in the appropriate tense (foi) + Past Participle (escrito) + Agent of the Passive (pelo gerente).",
    "correctFeedback": "The passive voice! You managed to sound detached and formal, just like a true bureaucrat. Well done.",

    "hint": "O uso da crase antes de pronomes possessivos femininos singulares é facultativo, mas se for plural, a crase é proibida. O verbo 'referir-se' exige a preposição 'a'.",
    "explanation": "O verbo 'referir-se' exige a preposição 'a'. Antes de pronomes possessivos femininos singulares ('sua'), a crase é facultativa, mas aceita. As opções com possessivos plurais ('suas') não admitem crase, e a opção sem crase é a forma facultativa.",
