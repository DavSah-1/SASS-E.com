    "hint": "The main clause ('Speravo' - Imperfect Indicative) requires the Imperfect Subjunctive in the subordinate clause (Sequence of Tenses).",
    "explanation": "The sequence of tenses dictates that a past tense verb in the main clause ('Speravo') requires a past subjunctive ('arrivassero') in the subordinate clause for simultaneous action.",
    "correctFeedback": "The sequence of tenses is tough, and yet, you nailed it. I'm starting to think you might actually be studying, which is frankly disappointing.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "That's the present subjunctive. 'I was hoping that they arrive'? Doesn't sound right, does it? You need the Imperfect Subjunctive to match the past tense of 'Speravo'."

    "hint": "The combined pronoun 'gli' (to him) + 'lo' (it) becomes 'glielo'. Note the mandatory apostrophe before the auxiliary verb.",
    "explanation": "The combination of the indirect pronoun 'gli' (to him) and the direct pronoun 'lo' (the gift) merges into 'glielo'. Since the auxiliary verb 'ho' starts with a vowel, the contraction 'gliel'ho' is correct.",
    "correctFeedback": "Composite pronouns are a nightmare, and you survived. I'm genuinely annoyed that you figured that out. Congratulations, I guess.",

    "correctFeedback": "The euphonic 'd' is tricky, but you spotted it. You must have a really boring life if you spend time memorizing these tiny details.",

    "explanation": "La congiunzione 'malgrado' (o 'nonostante') seguita da un sostantivo è la forma più concisa e corretta per esprimere una concessione a livello avanzato. 'Sebbene c'era' è grammaticalmente scorretto (dovrebbe essere 'sebbene ci fosse').",
