    "hint": "The adjective must agree in gender and number with the noun it modifies.",
    "explanation": "The noun 'cheveux' (hair) is masculine plural in French. Therefore, the adjective 'blond' must also be masculine plural: 'blonds'.",
    "correctFeedback": "Agreement in number and gender. Basic stuff, but you got it right. 'Blonds' matches the masculine plural 'cheveux.' Don't strain yourself celebrating this minor victory.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "You forgot the plural 's'! 'Cheveux' is plural, so the adjective must be plural. This is French 101 agreement. Were you distracted by her blonde hair? Focus!"

    "correctAnswer": "y",

    "explanation": "The pronoun 'y' replaces a complement introduced by the preposition 'à' (or sometimes 'sur', 'dans', etc.) when referring to a thing or a place. 'Penser à quelque chose' becomes 'y penser'.",
    "correctFeedback": "The adverbial pronoun 'y'. Very sophisticated. You correctly identified that 'mon voyage en Asie' is a thing introduced by 'à'. You might actually be learning something. Stop it.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "You used 'en'? 'En' replaces complements introduced by 'de'. The original sentence uses 'à' ('penser à'). If you can't distinguish between 'à' and 'de', maybe stick to English for a while."

    "hint": "Look for the most common and idiomatic way to express necessity/impersonality.",
    "explanation": "'Il faut' (it is necessary) is the most common impersonal way to express obligation. 'Se dépêcher' is the standard reflexive verb meaning 'to hurry up.' While 'On doit se dépêcher' is grammatically possible, 'Il faut se dépêcher' is often preferred for general necessity.",
    "correctFeedback": "'Il faut se dépêcher.' Good job using the impersonal structure. You're efficient, which is more than I can say for most students.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "You missed the reflexive pronoun in 'dépêcher.' You can't just 'dépêcher' (dispatch/send off) yourself; you have to 'se dépêcher' (hurry *oneself*). Did you forget French verbs are dramatic and need their pronouns?"

    "explanation": "The superlative of the adjective 'bon' (good) is irregular: 'le meilleur' (the best). 'Mieux' is the adverbial superlative (the best way/better). 'Film' is masculine.",
    "correctFeedback": "Irregular forms are usually where people fail, but you remembered 'le meilleur.' You're either a genius or you just got lucky. I'm leaning toward luck.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "You chose 'le plus bon'? That's a literal, word-for-word translation from English that doesn't exist in French. The irregular form is 'le meilleur'! Go back to basics, amateur."

    "hint": "This is reported speech (discours indirect) in the past. The future simple in direct speech becomes the conditional present.",
    "explanation": "When reporting speech in the past ('Elle m'a dit que...'), the original future action ('Je viendrai') shifts to the conditional present ('viendrait') in French, a concept known as 'concordance des temps' (sequence of tenses).",
    "correctFeedback": "Sequence of tenses! The conditional present ('viendrait') is the correct choice for reported future action in the past. You actually handled the 'discours indirect' without collapsing. Impressive, I guess.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "You used the future tense ('viendra')! When reporting speech in the past, the future shifts to the conditional. This is a crucial rule for intermediate French. Did you think French tenses were optional?"

    "hint": "Pensez au sens de 'regagner' ou 'retrouver' spécifiquement dans un contexte abstrait comme la confiance ou la santé.",
    "explanation": "Le verbe 'recouvrer' signifie 'rentrer en possession de', souvent utilisé pour des choses abstraites comme la santé, la liberté, ou la confiance. 'Récupérer' est plus souvent utilisé pour des objets physiques ou des données. 'Recouvrir' signifie 'couvrir à nouveau'.",
