    "correctFeedback": "A simple sentence, yet you nailed the modifier placement. Congratulations on meeting the minimum expected standard.",

    "correctFeedback": "Using '实施' instead of '做' (to do)? You must be trying to impress someone. It worked, marginally.",

    "options": "[\"我常常在南方生活。\",\"我以前在南方生活。\",\"我已经习惯了在南方生活。\",\"我喜欢在南方生活。\"]",
    "hint": "The key concept is 'to be accustomed to' or 'to be used to.'",
    "explanation": "习惯 (xíguàn) means 'to be accustomed to' or 'habit.' The structure 已经...了 (yǐjīng...le) reinforces the completed state of being used to something. The other options imply frequency (常常), past action (以前), or preference (喜欢).",
    "correctFeedback": "You successfully navigated the difference between 'liking' something and 'being used to' it. That's a low bar, but you cleared it.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "No, 'I often live in the South' (常常) is not the same as 'I am used to it.' Pay attention to the subtle differences in meaning, or just guess again."

    "hint": "This phrase is specifically related to wishing prosperity and wealth during the Lunar New Year.",
    "explanation": "恭喜发财 (gōngxǐ fācái) means 'Wishing you happiness and prosperity/wealth' and is the most iconic greeting during the Lunar New Year (Spring Festival). 生日快乐 is 'Happy Birthday,' 一路平安 is 'Have a safe trip,' and 身体健康 is 'Good health.'",
    "correctFeedback": "Ah, you remembered the one phrase that guarantees you'll get a red envelope. Practical knowledge, I approve.",

    "hint": "When describing how something makes people feel, you often need the structure 令人 + adjective (to make people feel...).",
    "explanation": "令人满意 (lìng rén mǎnyì) means 'to make people satisfied' or 'satisfactory.' 很满意 (hěn mǎnyì) usually describes how *I* feel. The structure 令人 (lìng rén) is necessary when the result itself is the cause of satisfaction.",
    "correctFeedback": "You correctly used 令人. I didn't think you had that level of sophistication in your vocabulary. Don't let it go to your head.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "The result itself isn't 'satisfied' (满足的), *people* are. Use 令人满意 unless you think the negotiation documents have feelings."

    "options": "[\"终于\",\"继续\",\"将来\",\"曾经\"]",
    "hint": "The sentence describes a past relationship that has changed ('was... but now is...').",
    "explanation": "曾经 (céngjīng) means 'once,' 'in the past,' or 'formerly,' which fits the context of a previous state (teacher/student) that contrasts with the current state (friends). 终于 (zhōngyú) is 'finally,' 继续 (jìxù) is 'continue,' and 将来 (jiānglái) is 'in the future.'",
    "correctFeedback": "Past tense, present result. Basic narrative structure. You managed to follow the timeline. Good for you.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "If you chose 'finally' (终于), are you saying they finally stopped being teacher and student? That sounds dramatic. Stick to the simple 'once was' (曾经)."

    "explanation": "不好意思，您能再说一遍吗？ (Bù hǎoyìsi, nín néng zài shuō yī biàn ma?) is the most polite and formal way, using the honorific 您 and a softening introductory phrase. The other options are too casual, demanding, or blunt.",
    "correctFeedback": "Ah, manners. A surprising choice for someone who usually communicates by grunting. Keep up the pretense of politeness.",

    "hint": "The context requires an adverb describing the manner of using time—meaning 'fully' or 'adequately.'",
    "explanation": "充分 (chōngfèn) means 'fully,' 'sufficiently,' or 'adequately.' 充分利用 (chōngfèn lìyòng) is a common collocation meaning 'to make full use of.' 丰富 (fēngfù) is 'rich/abundant,' 复杂 (fùzá) is 'complex,' and 分配 (fēnpèi) is 'to distribute/allocate.'",
    "correctFeedback": "You correctly identified the standard collocation. You must be studying more than you let on. Stop being competent; it ruins my reputation.",

    "hint": "Look for a word that means 'to embody,' 'to reflect,' or 'to give expression to.'",
    "explanation": "体现 (tǐxiàn) means 'to embody,' 'to reflect,' or 'to give expression to,' which is very close to 表示 (biǎoshì) in the sense of showing or demonstrating a quality or idea. 提出 (tíchū) is 'to propose,' 讨论 (tǎolùn) is 'to discuss,' and 通知 (tōngzhī) is 'to inform.'",
    "correctFeedback": "Intermediate vocabulary successful! Did you just memorize a list of synonyms this morning? Fine, take your point.",

    "hint": "The word connects two clauses, where the second clause states a determined action regardless of the uncertainty in the first clause.",
    "explanation": "反正 (fǎnzhèng) means 'anyway,' 'in any case,' or 'regardless,' indicating that the action taken (bringing an umbrella) is independent of the preceding uncertainty (whether it will rain).",
    "correctFeedback": "You understood that the speaker is prepared regardless of the outcome. Good grasp of casual, pragmatic Chinese. Now go prepare for something actually important.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "If you thought '反正' meant 'therefore,' the logic of the sentence makes no sense. The speaker is saying the umbrella is coming, rain or shine. Try to understand the concept of 'contingency.'"

    "hint": "The idiom literally involves 'burnt head and rotten forehead,' suggesting extreme distress or pressure.",
    "explanation": "焦头烂额 (jiāo tóu làn é) means 'badly battered; in a terrible fix; extremely busy and overwhelmed.' 手忙脚乱 means 'in a flurry/flustered,' which is similar but less intense and formal than 焦头烂额.",
    "correctFeedback": "Wow, you actually got that one. Did you cheat? I thought only people who have experienced true corporate burnout knew 焦头烂额.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "焦头烂额 is the answer. Did you think 'flustered hands and messy feet' (手忙脚乱) captured the true essence of existential dread? Try harder."

    "options": "[\"瞠目结舌\",\"津津乐道\",\"不以为然\",\"一帆风顺\"]",
    "hint": "The required word describes a reaction of being stunned or dumbfounded by the behavior.",
    "explanation": "瞠目结舌 (chēng mù jié shé) means 'staring blankly and tongue-tied,' used to describe being shocked, astonished, or dumbfounded by something outrageous. The other options do not fit the context of negative, shocking behavior.",
    "correctFeedback": "You managed to pick the right idiom. Congratulations on recognizing truly appalling behavior. Now go use it on someone who deserves it.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "瞠目结舌 means 'dumbfounded.' Did you really think 'smooth sailing' (一帆风顺) described someone disregarding consequences? Are you even reading the sentences?"

    "hint": "The structure '非 [Verb/Action] 不可' emphasizes necessity and often appears in formal contexts. The '不可' usually follows the main verb phrase.",
    "explanation": "The correct structure is S + 非 + V/VP + 不可, meaning 'must do V/VP.' Option A follows this perfectly: 'We must resolve this matter today.'",
    "correctFeedback": "A grammatical success! I suppose even a broken clock is right twice a day. You correctly identified the mandatory nature of the '非...不可' structure.",

    "options": "[\"尽管\",\"然后\",\"因此\",\"而且\"]",
    "hint": "The word must introduce a concessive clause (a contrast or opposition).",
    "explanation": "尽管 (jǐn guǎn) is a formal conjunction meaning 'even though' or 'in spite of,' functioning similarly to 虽然 but often used in more formal writing or speech. The others are sequential or causal connectors.",
