    "explanation": "Несмотря на requires the Accusative case (плохую погоду). Туристы (hikers/tourists) is the subject. Продолжить is the perfective infinitive 'to continue'.",
    "correctFeedback": "A successful translation! I'm genuinely surprised you remembered that 'несмотря на' needs the Accusative. Did you accidentally study that rule?",
    "incorrectFeedback": "Incorrect. 'Despite' is a tricky preposition, isn't it? It seems you just guessed the case. Go back and review 'несмотря на' before you accidentally insult a native speaker with your grammar."

    "options": null,
    "hint": "The verb 'to apologize' (извиниться) usually takes 'за' + Accusative to indicate the reason. 'To be punctual' is пунктуальный.",
    "explanation": "Извинилась за опоздание (apologized for the lateness/being late). Пообещала (perfective past) means 'promised'. Пунктуальной is in the Instrumental case because it follows 'быть' (to be) describing a temporary state.",
    "correctFeedback": "You managed to handle the verb conjugations and case usage without causing a grammatical catastrophe. Congratulations on meeting the minimum standard.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "That sentence is a mess. Did you forget how to apologize correctly? The structure 'apologized for X' is crucial here. Try again, and maybe apologize to the Russian language for that attempt."

    "hint": "This is a hypothetical conditional sentence (Subjunctive Mood). Remember the particle 'бы' is essential here.",
    "explanation": "The conditional mood is formed using the past tense verb + the particle 'бы'. 'Если бы я только знал' (If only I had known). 'Подготовился лучше' (would have prepared better).",
    "correctFeedback": "Conditional sentences are usually where people give up, but you navigated the 'бы' particle like a seasoned pro. Don't let this success go to your head; it was probably a fluke.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "That doesn't sound like regret; it sounds like gibberish. You completely missed the structure for expressing hypothetical past situations. Hint: 'бы' is your friend. A very demanding friend."

    "explanation": "Правительство (government, singular) планирует (plans). Увеличить (to increase, perfective). Налоги (taxes) is the direct object (Accusative). На импортные товары (on imported goods, Accusative).",
    "correctFeedback": "A perfectly serviceable translation of boring economic policy. You correctly handled the cases related to 'increase taxes on X.' Go celebrate your mastery of fiscal terminology.",

    "correctFeedback": "Polite, accurate, and grammatically sound. You successfully navigated the indirect question structure. Now try asking for directions in real life without panicking.",

    "explanation": "Нам (Dative, to us). Потребовалось (it took, impersonal past). Три часа (Nominative/Accusative depending on context, but here following the numeral 'три'). Добраться (perfective infinitive, to reach). Вершины горы (Genitive case, top of the mountain).",
    "correctFeedback": "You successfully handled the impersonal 'it took' structure and the tricky numeral agreement. I'm impressed you didn't use a clumsy literal translation.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "Wrong. You translated this literally, which is always a bad idea in Russian. 'It took' is an impersonal construction. Your version sounds like you personally consumed three hours."

    "explanation": "Роман (novel, masculine, Nominative). Который (masculine, Nominative, subject of the clause). Был опубликован (was published, passive voice). Стал бестселлером (became a bestseller, Instrumental case required after 'стал').",
    "correctFeedback": "Relative clauses are often a source of great confusion, yet you managed to use 'который' correctly. You must be having a good day.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "You messed up the relative pronoun. 'Который' needs to agree with 'роман.' It seems you just threw a random word in there and hoped for the best. Try again, but this time, try caring."

    "explanation": "В настоящее время (currently). Учится за границей (is studying abroad). Специализируясь (adverbial participle, specializing). На международном праве (Prepositional case required after 'специализироваться на').",
    "correctFeedback": "A perfect use of the adverbial participle! That's an intermediate skill that usually requires actual effort. Well done, you've earned a momentary reprieve from my sarcasm.",

    "correctFeedback": "You remembered the tricky Instrumental case after the future negative of 'быть.' Either you studied hard, or you got incredibly lucky. I'm betting on the latter.",
