    "incorrectFeedback": "If you used 'o', you just told me you are performing an action on the dogs, which is weird. 'Suki' needs 'ga'. Learn the exceptions, or suffer the consequences."

    "correctFeedback": "Ironic, isn't it? You correctly translated 'I don't understand Japanese' into Japanese. At least you know what you don't know.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "If you used the wrong particle, you're saying the Japanese language doesn't understand you, which is probably true, but grammatically incorrect. Use 'ga' with 'wakarimasu'."

    "correctFeedback": "Punctuality is overrated, but knowing how to ask the time is essential. You managed to combine two basic question words. Bravo.",

    "correctFeedback": "A clear statement of intent. If only your commitment to studying Japanese was as strong as your translated intention to quit your job. Well done.",

    "correctFeedback": "Scandalous! And grammatically perfect! You handled the passive reporting structure flawlessly. Maybe you should become a journalist.",

    "options": null,
    "hint": "'Downsize' can be 規模縮小 (scale reduction). 'Met with backlash' is often expressed using 反発を招く (to invite/cause backlash). 'Culminating in' can be expressed using 最終的には～へと発展した (finally developed into).",
    "explanation": "相当な反発 (considerable backlash) is a strong phrase. 招き (to invite/cause) is a good formal connector. 長期にわたる (protracted/long-term) and 交渉プロセスへと発展した (developed into a negotiation process) completes the complex sentence structure.",
    "correctFeedback": "A passable translation of corporate jargon. I guess you read the business section sometimes. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone you're trying to sound smart.",

    "explanation": "真意を見抜く (to see through true intentions) is idiomatic. 驚くべき能力 (uncanny ability) fits the tone. 磨かれたスキル (a polished skill) is a sophisticated way to express 'honed skill,' connected using the relative clause structure.",

    "explanation": "「困ったものだ」is an idiomatic expression used to express exasperation or annoyance about a situation or person's behavior. It means 'It's quite troublesome' or 'What a nuisance.'",
    "correctFeedback": "Wow, you managed to pick the right one. Did you cheat, or are you actually starting to grasp the nuances of Japanese exasperation? Either way, don't expect a medal.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "Wrong. '困ったものだ' expresses annoyance. Did you think Japanese people just politely smile when someone is always late? Try again, but maybe use your brain this time."

    "hint": "The sentence implies a negative cause and effect relationship. She missed school *because* of the illness.",
    "explanation": "「のせいで」means 'because of' or 'due to,' and is typically used when the cause leads to a negative result or consequence. 「にもかかわらず」means 'in spite of' (contrast), and 「によって」means 'by means of' or 'due to' (neutral/formal cause).",

    "hint": "You need the humble form (謙譲語) of 'to say' or 'to tell' when speaking about your actions to your superior (上司).",
    "explanation": "「申し上げる」is the humble form (謙譲語) of 「言う」 (to say) or 「伝える」 (to tell), used when the action is directed toward a superior (上司). 「申します」 is also humble, but 「申し上げます」 is typically preferred in this context for expressing opinions/requests formally.",

    "hint": "The key grammar point is expressing regret about a past action that did *not* happen. Look for the structure that handles 'regretting X.'",
    "explanation": "「後悔している」means 'I regret.' The structure 'Xをしたことを後悔している' means 'I regret doing X.' The correct answer uses the negative past tense of 'study' (勉強しなかった) combined with '後悔している' (regret). Option C, '勉強すればよかった,' means 'I wish I had studied,' which is similar but less direct than the required translation.",
    "correctFeedback": "A full sentence translation? You must be feeling ambitious today. And you nailed it. Don't get used to this feeling of success; it's probably temporary.",

    "hint": "The verb needs to mean 'to make X a reality' or 'to achieve X,' often implying effort or overcoming obstacles.",
    "explanation": "「実現させる」is the causative form of 「実現する」 (to realize/come true). It means 'to make [something] a reality' or 'to bring [something] about.' Given the context of overcoming family opposition (反対を押し切って), the causative form emphasizes her active effort in achieving the dream.",
    "correctFeedback": "Causative form! You correctly identified that she *made* the dream happen, rather than it just happening passively. Maybe there's hope for your understanding of agency after all.",

    "correctFeedback": "Vocabulary win! You know the word for 'meticulous.' Now, if only you applied that level of detail to your studying, you wouldn't need these silly tests.",

    "correctFeedback": "Ah, 'prior to.' Excellent use of formal sequencing. You managed to structure your actions logically. Did you accidentally wander into a business meeting? Impressive.",

    "hint": "The question asks if the report has been submitted. The response should indicate that it is currently unfinished.",
    "explanation": "「書きかけ」 (kakikake) means 'in the middle of writing' or 'half-written.' It is the most natural way to respond negatively to a submission question while indicating the current status of the work.",
    "correctFeedback": "You correctly identified that '書きかけ' means 'half-finished.' A perfect excuse for procrastination, wrapped in polite Japanese. Well done.",

    "explanation": "「Vることはない」 means 'there is no need to V' or 'it is unnecessary to V.' Since the question asks if it needs to be finished by tomorrow, the appropriate negative response is that finishing it today is unnecessary.",
    "correctFeedback": "You successfully negated the necessity. 'Vることはない' is a solid intermediate structure. You're learning how to politely slack off in Japanese. I approve.",

    "correctFeedback": "The 'change of state' grammar point. You correctly identified the shift from 'not studying' to 'studying.' See? Anime isn't completely useless.",

    "correctFeedback": "Emphasis achieved! 'こそ' shows you know how to stress a point. You managed to use a particle for emotional impact. Maybe you have a soul after all.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "No, 'こそ' is for emphasis. 'だけ' (only) or 'さえ' (even) don't fit the contrasting context as well. He's busy, but family is the *very thing* he prioritizes. Try to feel the emphasis next time."
