    "options": null,

    "options": "[\"A pesar de que\",\"En caso de que\",\"Por mucho que\",\"Siempre que\"]",
    "hint": "The phrase needed here means 'No matter how much' or 'However much.'",
    "explanation": "'Por mucho que' means 'no matter how much' and is followed by the subjunctive (implied 'pides' would be 'pidas' if the verb were present subjunctive, but here the structure is fixed). It expresses concession.",
    "correctFeedback": "You successfully navigated a complex concessive phrase. Are you sure you're not a robot programmed for grammar? If so, beep boop, good job.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "That phrase doesn't fit the context of refusal. You need a strong concessive structure. Go look up 'Por mucho que' and weep over your lack of vocabulary."

    "hint": "Verbs of volition, command, or influence require the subjunctive in the dependent clause. Since the main verb is in the past, you need the imperfect subjunctive.",
    "explanation": "The verb 'insistir en que' (to insist that) requires the subjunctive. Since the main clause is in the preterite ('insistió'), the dependent clause must use the imperfect subjunctive ('termináramos').",
    "correctFeedback": "Imperfect subjunctive after a past command! That's advanced stuff. I'm shocked. Truly. Try not to mess up the next one.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "The manager insisted! That's a command/influence, requiring the subjunctive. You used the indicative, implying you just stated a fact. The manager is disappointed in your grammar, and so am I."

    "correctAnswer": "parezca",
    "options": "[\"parece\",\"parezca\",\"parecería\",\"pareciera\"]",
    "hint": "The connector 'Aunque' requires the subjunctive when expressing a hypothetical or concession that doesn't fully negate the main clause's doubt.",
    "explanation": "The conjunction 'Aunque' (although/even though) requires the present subjunctive ('parezca') when the speaker wishes to express a concession while emphasizing the uncertainty or doubt that follows (the remaining doubts). 'Parece' (indicative) would imply the report *is* definitively convincing, which contradicts the second part of the sentence.",
    "correctFeedback": "Wow, you managed to use the subjunctive correctly. Did you accidentally study? Don't let it happen again.",

    "hint": "Look for the advanced conditional structure, often involving the perfect infinitive ('De haber + participio').",
    "explanation": "The structure 'De haber + participio' is an advanced, concise way to express the third conditional ('Si hubiera sabido...') in Spanish, meaning 'If I had known' or 'Had I known.' The main clause requires the conditional perfect ('habría actuado').",
    "correctFeedback": "You nailed the conditional perfect and the 'De haber' construction. Are you sure you're not cheating? This is too sophisticated for a casual learner.",

    "options": "[\"apogeo\",\"cénit\",\"acmé\",\"cenit\"]",
    "hint": "Two options mean the same thing, but one is much more common in formal Spanish and is often used metaphorically for a peak moment. Pay attention to the accent mark.",
    "explanation": "'Cenit' (or 'cénit,' though 'cenit' is increasingly common and accepted without the accent in Spanish) means zenith or peak. 'Apogeo' is also correct, but 'cenit' is often preferred in formal political/career contexts. Note that the RAE accepts both 'cenit' and 'cénit.' We choose 'cenit' as a common variant.",

    "hint": "This requires an idiomatic phrase using the subjunctive to express absolute necessity or inevitability.",
    "explanation": "'Pase lo que pase' is the standard, idiomatic expression in Spanish for 'come what may' or 'no matter what happens.' It uses the present subjunctive to convey the indefinite nature of the future events.",
    "correctFeedback": "An idiom! You actually remembered an idiom. I'm genuinely shocked. Did you write that down on your hand?",

    "correctAnswer": "magullaba",
    "options": "[\"magullé\",\"magullaba\",\"magullaría\",\"magullase\"]",
    "hint": "The context 'Cuando era niño' and 'siempre' demands the imperfect tense for habitual actions in the past.",
    "explanation": "The imperfect tense ('magullaba') is required here because the sentence describes a habitual, repeated action in the past ('siempre me magullaba la rodilla' - I was always bruising my knee) within a defined past period ('Cuando era niño'). The preterite ('magullé') would imply a single, completed action.",
    "correctFeedback": "Imperfect tense for habitual past actions. Groundbreaking. You managed to follow the most basic rule of advanced Spanish. Bravo.",

    "hint": "The personal 'a' is used before direct objects that are specific people or personified entities.",
    "explanation": "The personal 'a' is mandatory before 'un testigo clave' (a key witness) because the direct object is a specific person. It is not used before inanimate objects like 'coche,' 'evidencia,' or 'solución.'",
    "correctFeedback": "Aha! You remembered the personal 'a.' I suppose even a broken clock is right twice a day. Now, try to remember why you woke up this morning.",

    "explanation": "'A causa de' is a standard compound preposition meaning 'due to' or 'because of.' 'Debido a' is also correct, but 'A causa de' is a perfectly valid and common advanced structure.",
    "correctFeedback": "You successfully navigated the treacherous waters of compound prepositions. I'm not impressed, but I am slightly less disappointed.",

    "hint": "Look for advanced vocabulary ('vehemencia') and a formal conjunction ('si bien') to convey the contrast effectively.",
    "explanation": "'Dar la impresión de' is a strong alternative to 'parecer.' 'Si bien' (although/even though) is a more formal and nuanced conjunction than 'aunque' or 'pero.' 'Con vehemencia' is a precise translation for 'vehemently.'",
    "correctFeedback": "Using 'si bien' and 'vehemencia'? You're showing off now. Stop trying to make the rest of the class look bad.",

    "hint": "This is a mixed conditional sentence (third conditional in the 'si' clause, conditional simple in the main clause), requiring the past perfect subjunctive.",
    "explanation": "This is a mixed conditional structure: the condition refers to an impossible past event (third conditional: 'Si el tren no hubiera llegado con retraso') and the result refers to the present ('ahora estaríamos en Madrid'). The 'si' clause requires the past perfect subjunctive ('hubiera llegado').",
    "correctFeedback": "The past perfect subjunctive! You actually remembered three parts of the verb. I'm going to assume that was dumb luck, but I'll mark it correct.",

    "hint": "When 'haber' is used impersonally (meaning 'there is/are' or 'it is necessary'), it *always* remains in the third-person singular.",
    "explanation": "The impersonal construction 'haber que + infinitive' (meaning 'it is necessary to...') always uses the third-person singular form of 'haber,' regardless of the tense. In the imperfect, this is 'Había que.'",
    "correctFeedback": "You avoided the classic trap of pluralizing impersonal 'haber.' Are you sure you're not a native speaker pretending to be a student?",

    "hint": "The verb 'pedir' (to ask/request) triggers the subjunctive in the dependent clause, and since the main verb is in the past, the dependent clause must be in the imperfect subjunctive.",
    "explanation": "The main clause verb ('pidió' - preterite) triggers the use of the imperfect subjunctive ('informara') in the subordinate clause, as it is an indirect command/request concerning a past action.",
