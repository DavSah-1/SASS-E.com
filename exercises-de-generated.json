    "options": "[\"doch\",\"mal\",\"eben\",\"echt\"]",
    "hint": "The particle should convey genuine surprise about the positive outcome.",
    "explanation": "'Echt' (really/truly) is often used as a modal particle to express genuine surprise or disbelief in a positive context.",
    "correctFeedback": "Modal particles! The spice of German conversation. You managed to pick the right one. I'm genuinely surprised, which means you did well.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "'Doch' is for contradiction or emphasis. 'Eben' implies something obvious. You failed to grasp the subtle art of German emotional expression. Try again."

    "question": "Choose the correct phrase to express a lack of necessity: 'You don't have to wait for me.'",
    "correctAnswer": "Du brauchst nicht auf mich zu warten.",
    "options": "[\"Du musst nicht auf mich warten.\",\"Du brauchst nicht auf mich zu warten.\",\"Du darfst nicht auf mich warten.\",\"Du sollst nicht auf mich warten.\"]",
    "hint": "While 'müssen nicht' works, the 'brauchen... zu' construction is a common, slightly softer way to express 'do not need to.'",
    "explanation": "The construction 'brauchen + nicht + zu + infinitive' is the standard intermediate way to express 'not needing to do something,' often preferred over 'nicht müssen.'",
    "correctFeedback": "Ah, the sophisticated 'brauchen... zu' construction. You avoided the beginner trap of 'nicht müssen.' Did someone finally teach you something useful?",
    "incorrectFeedback": "'Müssen nicht' is grammatically okay, but 'brauchen... zu' is more natural and what we were testing. You chose the lazy option. Try harder."

    "hint": "The Plusquamperfekt requires the auxiliary verb ('haben' or 'sein') in the simple past (Präteritum). The verb 'essen' takes 'haben.'",
    "explanation": "The Plusquamperfekt describes an action completed before another past action. It uses the Präteritum form of the auxiliary verb ('hatte') plus the Partizip II ('gegessen'). The main clause verb ('ging') must be in the Präteritum.",
    "correctFeedback": "You correctly sequenced two past events using the Plusquamperfekt. That means you understand time travel, or at least German grammar. Probably the latter.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "You mixed tenses or auxiliary verbs. 'Hat' is present tense. 'Wurde' is passive. Get your auxiliary verbs right, or your timeline will forever be messed up."

    "hint": "Think about major social events and the impossibility of being present at two different locations at the same time.",
    "explanation": "\"Auf zwei Hochzeiten tanzen\" literally means 'to dance at two weddings' and is used to describe trying to manage two conflicting responsibilities or goals, often resulting in failure at both.",
    "correctFeedback": "Wow, you actually know a German idiom that isn't 'Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof.' Did you cheat, or are you finally paying attention?",
    "incorrectFeedback": "Seriously? You picked 'licking honey around the mouth'? That's not even close. Perhaps stick to learning how to order beer before attempting advanced idioms."

    "hint": "The unreal past condition requires the use of the past perfect forms of 'sein' or 'haben' in the Konjunktiv II.",
    "explanation": "The correct structure for an unreal past condition (If he had arrived earlier...) is 'Wäre er früher angekommen' (Konjunktiv II of 'sein' + Past Participle) followed by 'hätte er den Zug noch erreicht' (Konjunktiv II of 'haben' + Past Participle).",
    "correctFeedback": "Unreal past conditions? You mastered that? I'm almost impressed. Don't let it go to your head, though; there are still 10,000 exceptions waiting.",

    "hint": "Remember that 'trotz' (despite) is a preposition that usually governs the genitive case, and pay attention to verb placement (V2 rule).",
    "explanation": "'Trotz' requires the genitive case ('des starken Regens'). The main clause follows the V2 rule: 'fand' (verb) immediately after the initial element ('Trotz des starken Regens').",
    "correctFeedback": "A correct translation? You must have accidentally remembered the genitive case. Don't worry, you'll forget it again by tomorrow.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "You used 'obwohl' and then messed up the word order. German word order is not a suggestion, it's a law. Now go write out the V2 rule 50 times."

    "hint": "The particle should imply that the action is obvious or overdue.",
    "explanation": "The particle 'doch' is often used in requests or commands to add emphasis, impatience, or to imply that the action should have been performed already. ('Kannst du die Tür ZU MACHEN!')",
    "correctFeedback": "You successfully navigated the treacherous waters of German Modal Particles. I'm shocked. Now try using it in a real conversation without sounding like a tourist reading a textbook.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "You picked 'wohl'? That suggests uncertainty, not annoyance. Your attempt to sound authentically German just made you sound vaguely confused. Stick to 'bitte' for now."

    "options": "[\"verschieben\",\"verlegen\",\"vertagen\",\"verzögern\"]",
    "hint": "Look for the verb specifically used for formally delaying meetings, sessions, or parliamentary debates.",
    "explanation": "While 'verschieben' is generally 'to postpone,' 'vertagen' is the specific, formal term used in business, legal, or political contexts for postponing or adjourning a meeting or session.",
    "correctFeedback": "Ah, 'vertagen.' Very sophisticated. Are you sure you aren't secretly a high-ranking executive trying to sound smart while avoiding actual work?",
    "incorrectFeedback": "'Verzögern' means 'to delay' or 'to slow down.' The meeting wasn't just slow; it was formally put off. Precision, people! This is German, not playground chatter."

    "hint": "When referring to a whole preceding statement or idea, German uses a specific neuter relative pronoun.",
    "explanation": "When the relative clause refers to the entire preceding clause ('He rejected the project'), the pronoun 'was' (neuter singular) is used, often preceded by a comma.",
    "correctFeedback": "You managed to use 'was' correctly without confusing it with 'dass.' I'm going to assume this was a fluke, but enjoy the fleeting moment of grammatical superiority.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "You used 'welcher.' 'Welcher' refers to a specific masculine noun. Did the project itself disappoint you, or the action of rejecting it? Context matters, dummy."

    "hint": "Think about the traditional characteristics attributed to the animal in European folklore and fables.",
    "explanation": "In German (and many other languages), the fox ('Fuchs') symbolizes cunning, cleverness, and sometimes slyness or trickery.",
    "correctFeedback": "Yes, German metaphors align with basic human observation. You deserve a gold star for recognizing that a fox isn't usually associated with heavy sleeping.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "A heavy sleeper? Did you think this was some kind of obscure German reference to narcolepsy? It means 'cunning.' Try reading a children's book sometime."

    "hint": "Remember that both 'je' and 'desto' clauses require the verb to be placed at the end of the subordinate clause ('je') or immediately after the comparative phrase ('desto').",
    "explanation": "The 'je' clause is a subordinate clause, placing the verb ('übte') at the end. The 'desto' clause is a main clause, but the comparative phrase ('desto besser') occupies the first position, forcing the verb ('wurde') into the second position.",
    "correctFeedback": "Perfect V2 placement after 'desto.' I didn't think you had it in you. Now go explain this to someone who still thinks German is just English spelled badly.",

    "explanation": "'Eine Entscheidung treffen' (to make/take a decision) is the most common and idiomatic fixed expression (Funktionsverbgefüge). 'Eine Entscheidung fassen' is also correct but slightly more formal/less common.",
    "correctFeedback": "You hit the nail on the head. Or, as Germans say, you 'trafen die Entscheidung.' Don't celebrate too hard; it's just one idiomatic phrase out of thousands.",

    "explanation": "'Ringen mit' means 'to wrestle with' or 'to grapple with' and is commonly used in journalistic and political language to describe handling a severe crisis or difficult issue.",
    "correctFeedback": "Excellent choice of high-level vocabulary. You've clearly been reading the 'Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung' instead of just looking at the pictures.",
    "incorrectFeedback": "'Kämpft gegen' means 'fights against.' While close, 'ringen mit' conveys the specific sense of struggling internally with a complex problem. Try to be less aggressive and more nuanced next time."

    "hint": "When modal verbs (like 'können') are used in the perfect tense with another infinitive (like 'hören'), the auxiliary 'haben' is placed before the two infinitives, which replace the past participle.",
    "explanation": "The Doppelinfinitiv rule dictates that when a modal verb is used with another infinitive, the past participle is replaced by the infinitive form of the modal verb, and both infinitives follow 'haben' at the end: 'haben' + object + infinitive 1 + infinitive 2 ('hören können').",
    "correctFeedback": "The Doppelinfinitiv! That's where most learners give up and switch to Dutch. You survived. I'm mildly impressed by your persistence.",
